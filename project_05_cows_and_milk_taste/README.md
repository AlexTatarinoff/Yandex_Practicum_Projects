## Predicting milk yield and taste of milk

We need to create two predictive models for selecting cows for purchase:

The first one will predict the possible milk yield of the cow (the target indicator is milk yield);
The second one will calculate the probability of getting delicious milk from a cow (the target attribute is the taste of milk).

We will use linear regression and logistic regression for these purposes.
