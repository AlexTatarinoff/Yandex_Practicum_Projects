## Text Classification With BERT

In this project, we will try to classify users messages as toxic or not-toxic, using classical models and BERT... and also pretrained RoBERTa! Gonna be hard like "System Of A Down"'s songs, but fun anyways.<br><br>
**Attention** <i>('s not all you need here)</i>: the initial data and the exact description of the project <u>are not provided</u>, it is forbidden by Practicum.
